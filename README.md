- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrom99, currently studying for an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology, and recently introduced to this amazing world of programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in development in Python, anything goes!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but might as well learn other languages while I'm at it!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing for now, mostly because I'm still getting started with this whole GitHub thing.
